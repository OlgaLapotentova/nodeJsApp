# Shop Angular Cloudfront

## The purpose

The repository was created to have an Angular version of e-shop for EPAM NodeJS AWS course. At the same time we strive to make this repository follows best practices so it may be used as a starter for new projects with all the necessary toolings already set up.

## NodeJS AWS course integration

All the necessary API endpoints are in the environments files `environment.ts` (for dev builds). Also it contains feature flags to enable/disable endpoints invocations from within the app so to ensure that you don't get errors for not implemented API endpoints.
